# Gracenote Sports Code Test

### Challenge
* Write an application in a language and framework of choice which processes the data contained in the attached soccer data file. You can make logical assumptions about the  data schema based on the file structure. You are free to choose your tools and libraries, pick one to best show your skills and in which you are comfortable.
    * Option 1: Create a client side single page application to enter data for league, matches, game events etc.
    * Option 2: Create a RESTful application that exposes the sport data as a set of endpoints

* Use the data in the file to produce aggregate data for the soccer matches. E.g.
    * Match details including line up
    * League tables
    * Game scores
    * Any other form of aggregation that you find interesting

* Write output in a format that you choose e.g. console output, file output, web application, api endpoints.
* Write production quality code (readable, tested, clear and concise)

### Timing and Delivery
* Spend a maximum of 1-2 hours on the test. We do not want a full solution, a partial solution or approach is acceptable.
